<hr />

<h3>Pulp Fiction</h3>
<p>This is my favourite Tarantino movie of all time. I love the originality and the story telling</p>

<h3>The dark night</h3>
<p>Nolan's best film it's amazingly written. It's a classic even thought it came out in 2008, it's a philosophical movie about human behavor </p>

<h3>the godfather II</h3>
<p>When it comes to cinematography and film making this is a classic</p>
